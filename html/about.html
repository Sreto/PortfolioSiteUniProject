                        I am 23 years old, and I am a recent information
                        technology graduate from Technical College Čačak,
                        Serbia. Since I was a kid, computers, video games,
                        animation and drawing have been my passion. As I was
                        curious and eager for new things, the endless video game
                        worlds and amazing adventures of my favourite animated
                        characters were more and more attracting me and I have
                        always felt like i was part of them. It was difficult to
                        choose just one field, so i decided to combine all of
                        them.

                        I want to become someone who will create new worlds and
                        give life to fictional characters. The path to this goal
                        is a long one, but with enough persistence and willpower
                        I hope to create something that everyone will love!

                        look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward,
                        opening up new doors and doing new things, because we’re
                        curious… and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths."
